Scripts to clean raw composition data. Reads in csv file with *ExtractedChemical_id*, *raw_min_comp*, *raw_central_comp*, and *raw_max_comp* fields and creates a csv with *ExtractedChemical_id*, *lower_wf_analysis*, *central_wf_analysis*, and *upper_wf_analysis* fields. If the raw data was a range in the *raw_central_comp field*, the range was split into the *lower_wf_analysis* and *upper_wf_analysis* fields, and an empty string was placed in the *central_wf_analysis* field in the cleaned dataframe. If the raw data was an inequality in the *raw_central_comp* field, the number was placed in either the *upper_wf_analysis* or *lower_wf_analysis* field and was then bounded by either 0 or 100 in the opposing field. An empty string was then placed in the *central_wf_analysis* field in the cleaned dataframe. A stand-alone numerical value in the *raw_central_comp* field was placed in *central_wf_analysis* field and empty strings were placed in the *upper_wf_analysis* and *lower_wf_analysis* fields in the cleaned dataframe. Raw compostion data in the form of a percent was transformed to weight fraction data in the cleaned dataframe. Raw composition data in the form of a weight fraction was kept as such. Raw data of other unit types as well as uninterpretable data and non-numerical data were removed. More details available in the *SOP for Composition Data Cleaning* on the wiki in the *ChemicalExposure-SSC* repo. 
Python version 3.7.3 and Pandas version  0.24.1.
