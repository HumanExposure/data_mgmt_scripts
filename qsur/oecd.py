            'Thickening agent': 'Chemical substances, typically hydrophilic, used to form solid or semisolid dispersions of a mixture or increase the viscosity of liquid mixtures and solutions and to aid in maintaining stability by their emulsifying properties without changing their other properties. Four classifications are recognized: 1) Starches, gums, casein, gelatine and phycocolloids; 2) semisynthetic cellulose derivatives (e.g. carboxymethyl-cellulose); 3) polyvinyl alcohol and carboxy-vinylates (synthetic); and 4) bentonite, silicates, and colloidal silica. May also be hydrophobic at lower temperatures. Also referred to as a rheology modifier; viscosity index improver. See closely related: density modifier; and viscosity modifier.',
            'Tracer': 'Chemical substance that possesses a readily detectable radioactive/isotopic label or chemical moiety which is added to biological/environmental media or chemical reactions to elucidate the transformation/transportation processes that are occurring.',
            'UV stabilizer': 'Chemical substance that protects the product from chemical or physical deterioration induced by ultraviolet light. Absorbs UV radiation, thereby protecting products including varnishes, pigments, and certain polymers against UV degradation. Also referred to as a UV absorber or light stabilizer.',
            'Vapor pressure modifiers': 'Chemical substance added to a liquid to modify its vapour pressure and to reduce evaporation.',
            'Viscosity modifier': 'Chemical substance used to alter the viscosity of another substance. Used to decrease or increase the viscosity of finished products; to modify the flow characteristics of other substances, or mixtures to which they are added; to control the deformation or flow ability of a wax product. High molecular weight pre-polymer resins and reactive precursor resins generally lower viscosity while thickeners (e.g., gums and hydroxyethyl cellulose) increase viscosity. Thermoplastic resins soften when exposed to heat and return to original form at room temperature, and thermosetting resins solidify irreversibly due to cross-linking when heated. Also referred to as a viscosity adjuster; or viscosity controlling agent. See closely related: density modifier; gelling modifier, thickening agent.',
            'Waterproofing agent': 'Chemical substance that lowers the surface energy to protect surfaces against water by forming water beads. Also referred to as a water-beading agent.',
            'Wetting agent (non-aqueous)': 'Chemical substance that promotes coating of an organic liquid on a solid material by lowering the surface tension. Note, the chemical substance is not added to water. Wetting agents that are added to water (aqueous wetting agents) are covered under the Surfactant (surface active agent) category.',
            'Wrinkle resisting agent': 'Chemical substance used to impart wrinkle-resistance in in textiles, paper and leather.',
            'X-Ray absorber': 'Chemical substance used to block or attenuate X-rays.',
            'No specific technical function': 'Chemical substance with no pre-defined function. If no specific technical function is selected, the function should be written in. (e.g. case where a processing aid remains in the matrix of an article without fulfilling any technical function during Service life)',
            'Other': 'Chemical substances contained in products intended for consumer, commercial, or industrial use that are not covered under another product category. Specify the function.',
