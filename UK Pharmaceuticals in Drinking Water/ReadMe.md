Extracts the chemical names and raw_category, when present, from tables in "A Desk Based Review of Current Knowledge on Pharmaceuticals in Drinking Water and Estimation of Potential Levels". Extracted tables are noted in each script. Note that while the report is the same, a different copy of the document is read in for each table to match with Factotum. A csv for each table is then generated which is to be uploaded into Factotum. Extraction used tabula-py version 1.1.1 and pandas version 0.24.1 in Python 3.7.3.
