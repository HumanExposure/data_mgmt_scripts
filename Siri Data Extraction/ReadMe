Siriall_find_html.py:
reads siriall.csv, checks to see if the corresponding html documents are in their corresponding folders, and makes columns for whether or not the file exists, and what the file name is (Note: this script makes a copy of the file and adds the columns to the copy. If you want to change the original, you must copy and paste the new columns into the original)
