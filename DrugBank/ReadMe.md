**drugbankDownload.py** uses Selenium and ChromeDriver to go to the [DrugBank website](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs), save images of the tables generated by selecting different filters, capture the data in those tables, and convert those images into pdfs. The script saves this data as a csv


To run:
- Create a folder to save documents in and change the path in line 17
- [Download ChromeDriver here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and change the path in line 31. The version of ChromeDriver you download should match the version you use in your regular Chrome browser.
