Inert Ingredients Alphabetical.py converts EPA inert ingredients lists pdfs into txt files using a pdftotxt converter (download at https://www.xpdfreader.com/download.html), then extracts data from each txt file into a pandas dataframe, and generates a csv to be uploaded to Factotum. (Written in Spyder, Python 3.7)

The other scripts extract chemicals and CAS numbers from the FDA group and places them in templates with other document information to be uploaded to factotum. The ingredients and CAS numbers were extracted using the Python package Camelot. In order to use Camelot, you must first download Ghostscript, and then install Camelot in a Python 3.6 environment. DO NOT attempt to install Camelot in Python 3.7. (Written in Spyder, Python 3.6)
