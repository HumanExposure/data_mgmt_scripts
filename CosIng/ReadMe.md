CosIngDownload.py uses Python 3.7 and Selenium to search the CosIng ingredients/fragrance inventory, navigate to each ingredient page, extract ingredient and use data, and save a copy of the ingredient page.

To search for active ingredients, change the number in the brackets in line 53 to 2. To search for non-active ingredients, change it to 3.
