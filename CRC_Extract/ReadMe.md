Many of the files had corrupt font-mapping, so OCR was used to generate text files


**crcOCR.py**: Uses pdf2image to convert each page of a pdf to a jpeg, uses pytesseract to read the pictures using OCR, writes text to a text file, then deletes the jpegs. Iterates over each pdf in the folder.


**crcExtract.py**: Reads the text files generated by crcORC.py, extracts product and ingredient info, and generates a csv to be uploaded to Factotum.
